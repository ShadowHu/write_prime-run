# write_prime-run
(Manjaro) Make all the desktop applications run on the Nvidia GPU

With the driver "video-hybrid-intel-nvidia-prime", you must type "prime-run" before every software you want it run on GPU.

So with this script you can batch modify all startup files, just write the needed software in "prime-run.txt"

and

sudo sh prime.sh
